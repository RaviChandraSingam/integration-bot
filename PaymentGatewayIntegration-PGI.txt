
### **Payment Gateway Integration (PGI)**
- **Function**: Facilitates integration with various payment gateways for processing online payments, bill payments, and merchant transactions.
- **APIs**: Process payments, validate payment details, retrieve payment status, and manage payment refunds.
- **Batch Components**: Scheduled settlement of payments, batch processing of refunds, and reconciliation with payment gateways.
- **Kafka Components**: Real-time payment processing, payment status updates, and notifications for payment failures or successes.
- **Documentation**: API integration guides, payment flow documentation, and batch processing instructions.

#### API Documentation
- **POST /payments**: Processes a new payment. Requires a JSON body with payment details.
- **GET /payments/{paymentId}**: Retrieves a payment by its ID.

#### Code Snippets
```python
import requests

# Base URL
base_url = "https://api.bank.com/v1"

# Process a new payment
new_payment = {
    "amount": 50.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "fromAccount": "account123",
    "toMerchant": "merchant456"
}
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/payments", json=new_payment)
print(response.json())

# Get payment by ID
payment_id = "payment123"
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/payments/{payment_id}")
print(response.json())
```

#### Kafka Topic Details
- **Topic Name**: `payment-events`
- **Purpose**: To stream real-time payment events.
- **Message Format**: JSON
```json
{
  "event": "PAYMENT_PROCESSED",
  "paymentId": "payment123",
  "details": {
    "amount": 50.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "fromAccount": "account123",
    "toMerchant": "merchant456",
    "status": "Completed",
    "timestamp": "2024-05-17T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
```

#### Documentation
- **API Specification**: Details the REST endpoints, request and response formats.
- **Integration Guide**: Steps on how to use the APIs, including authentication and error handling.
- **Kafka Integration**: Explains the Kafka topics, message formats, and how to consume messages.
- **Batch Processing**: Describes periodic batch processes for payment settlements and reconciliations.

### Comprehensive Documentation for Integration

#### Overview
This document outlines the APIs, Kafka topics, and batch processes for the following banking components:
- Customer Information Management System (CIMS)
- Transaction Processing System (TPS)
- Account Management System (AMS)
- Payment Gateway Integration (PGI)

#### Authentication
All API endpoints require authentication via an API key. Include the API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### Error Handling
All APIs follow a standard error response format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Error message describing the issue."
  }
}
```

#### Batch Processing
Each component supports batch processing for various periodic tasks such as data synchronization, reconciliation, and reporting. Details of these processes are provided in the respective sections.

#### Kafka Integration
Real-time updates and events are streamed via Kafka topics. Each component has specific topics with well-defined message formats.

### Example Integration Workflow
1. **Customer Creation**: Use the CIMS API to create a new customer.
2. **Account Opening**: Once the customer is created, use the AMS API to open a new account for the customer.
3. **Transaction Processing**: Use the TPS API to initiate transactions from the customerâ€™s account.
4. **Payment Processing**: Use the PGI API to process payments to merchants.
